# unit test substrate
It demonstrates how we can use [TUT, template unit test framework](http://mrzechonek.github.io/tut-framework/) in our own projects

# Building your own tests
To build the tests, you will require the following:

* [TUT framework](https://github.com/mrzechonek/tut-framework), to be cloned under the 'my_root_tut' directory in your file system structure 
* specify a path 'my_root_tut/include' in your project global settings
* include 'tut.h' header in every translation unit you want to test
