# Key/value storage at compile time as a list of types
Imagine there is some data known at compile time, two sets of integers representing API signals in separate and independent  
specifications.

Our goal is to make a bridge between these two worlds to be able to pass data from one to the another and vice verse.

Example of usage:
```cpp
```
